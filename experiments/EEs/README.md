## Reproducibility
`EEs-simu.ipynb` contains the codes to compute and save the simulation results of EEs and construct confidence intervals (CI) using saved results.
- **Different Distributions:**  
1. Compare coverage rate, power, and CI length of EEs and CLT methods under different types of data transformations.  
2. Both known variance ($Z$-statistics) and unknown variance ($T$-statistic) cases are considered.

- **Optimal $n$:**  
  Examine how coverage rate and CI length of EEs and CLT methods change with sample size $n$.

`EEs-real.ipynb`
contains code to apply EEs and CLT methods to generative models comparisons on TrivalQA data.
